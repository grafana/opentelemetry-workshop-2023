## Preface

Lab 3 introduces ways to scale OpenTelemetry implementations of high complexity or high traffic.

## 3.1 - Transformation

Let's explore the fundamentals of [transforming](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/transforming-telemetry/) data. You will see how to transform, clean, and enrich telemetry during its collection and transport.

> **Note** - This lab section requires the [otel-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

**Why use transformations?**

Transformations provide centralized control over the processing of telemetry. This is especially useful for platform teams who must keep data quality, costs, and performance under control for multiple tenants of OpenTelemetry.

* **Quality** - Normalizing telemetry on ingest ensures higher quality usage.
* **Costs & performance** - Excluding less valuable telemetry will help control the costs of transferring, storing, and querying telemetry while optimizing the performance of ingest and queries.

**Step 1.** Review the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for transformation: [`transformation/otel-collector-config.yaml`](transformation/otel-collector-config.yaml)

Questions to explore:

* Which processors serve the purpose of transformation?
* Which pipelines use which transformation processors?
* What benefits do those transformations offer?

**Step 2.** Run the app: `docker-compose --project-directory transformation --env-file ../env up --build`

**Step 3.** Open the app in a web browser: [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/)

**Step 4.** Select "grafanacloud-`orgname`-logs" as the data source, "Last 15 minutes" as the time range, and run this query: `{job="java-springboot"} | json`

Questions to explore:

* What happened to the `DEBUG` logs?
* What happened to the resource attributes?

**Step 5.** Stop the app using Ctrl+C or âŒ˜-C.
